<h1> THE STORY OF THE SUPER RANGERS </h1>

<p> There were once a group of heroes called the super rangers. They were just three high school 
boys with smarts and abilities. There were Jason, Jake and Jackson. They lived in a city called 
Metropolis Ville. They all had roles they played. Jason was their leader and planner, Jackson 
was the tech and driving expert and Jake was the martial arts expert. They had accomplished 
countless missions. <br> <br> 

This one time they fought a beast that was so powerful that it was a close shave to failure. 
This is how it all happened. It was a bright morning and they having breakfast and they decided 
to go for a walk in backyard. They later went for jogging in the city. On their way, they saw the 
citizens running in fear they were being chased by a beast who came out of nowhere. Later Jason 
devised a plan to help them defeat the beast the plan was to help the citizens evacuate then he 
and Jake will keep the monster busy while Jackson fixes up their enormous laser gun to destroy 
the monster. However their plan did not work because the beast was a mune to the energy source 
used to power the laser. After some scientific calculations they realised that in order to get 
to another power source fast enough will need to ride very fast so they sent Jackson on their 
sonic motorcycle. <br> <br> 

An hour later, Jackson was back with the power source. After using the new power source they 
were surprised that it had no effect on the furious beast. Then they found out that the monster 
was indestructible. So the only way was to use a chemical to weaken the aggressiveness of the 
monster So Jason and Jake kept on destructing the monster while Jackson worked on the chemical. 
When Jackson was done with the chemical, they still needed a way to get the chemical into the 
monster's mouth. So they decided to use live bait (Jackson). Even with Jackson they still needed 
a way to launch him with their canon. After this was done they succeeded. However, they still 
needed to get the monster out of the city. So they caged the monster and lifted him to the forest 
of the giant apes using their helicopter. <br> <br> 

After getting the monster to the forest of the giant apes, they decided to clean up the city. 
However it was not an easy tax because there were just three of them so they called on the citizens 
to help them restore the city to its formal glory. So they went to the nearby city to call the 
citizens of Metropolis Ville. They all agreed to help them restore the city. After some months 
Metropolis Ville was restored to its formal glory. And a celebration was held in honour of The Super 
Rangers. In the celebration the mayor gave the team some devices and gadgets. <br> <br> </p>
