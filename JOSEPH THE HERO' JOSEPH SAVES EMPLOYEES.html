<h1> JOSEPH THE HERO: JOSEPH SAVES EMPLOYEES </h1>

<p> <br>  There once lived a man with and three children: James, Jane, Jack and 
a wife called Diana. The man himself was also called Joseph. <br> <br>

One day, Joseph was going to work so he dropped his children at school before 
going. When he got to his work place, the place was very quiet. Then suddenly 
he saw two armed men holding some employees hostage so he immediately hid under
one of the desks in the office. When the men were not looking, he ran to press 
the button on the elevator and placed his phone in it. Then he used the office
phone to call his phone. <br> <br> 

Then one the armed men went inside the elevator to see what was going on. After
that he sneaked at the back of the last man and hit him with a vase. Meanwhile,
the rest of the employees were hiding in the parking lot and one of them had called 
the police. Joseph took the last man's gun and shot the man who went into the elevator.
After a while the police came and saw what he had done. Then the police along with the 
employees thanked joseph. The police also asked him to join the city's police squad 
Then he accepted it. </p>
