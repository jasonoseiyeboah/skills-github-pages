<h1> THE RISE OF SHADOW STRIKER </h1>

             <p>Long ago a city called Harrisville there lived a boy named Jackson.  One night after Jackson had came from camp he was sitting with 
his father in their living room. Then suddenly an assassin sent by his dad`s enemy came out of know where and killed his father. From that they 
Jackson trained himself to be a martial art fighter so that he can kill the assassin who killed his father.  Three days after his dad's funeral,
the president of the super hero league came to his house. Then he saw him training and asked him to join the super hero league and Jackson 
agreed. When he joined the league he was give lots of weapons, gadgets and a watch that will help him transform into his hero suit. Then he 
called himself shadow striker.<br> <br>

One day, his many attempts paid off because he had finally been able to locate the criminal and send him to jail. He then quitted being a super 
hero because he had finally gotten his revenge by terminating the assassin's boss. Things turned out great for him but not for the citizens of 
Harrisville. However, he did not notice. That night he and his mother celebrated their successful revenge. The next day, he went out for a walk 
then he saw that there was a lot of crime in the city. Immediately his saw that he rushed to his HQ, wore his suit and rush to fight the criminals.
Finally when he was done fighting he went home to eat lunch. At the table he realized that the city needs a super hero. So he decided to get back 
to work.<br> <br>

That same day, a group of pirates kidnapped a class of students and sent them to international waters to kill them because there were no rules 
there. But luckily for them shadow striker (Jackson) was there to help the class. He was also promoted to the league's best team "alpha strike" and
after a few more missions he was dominated team leader by his teammates.<br> <br>

One week later when everything was getting normal, a spaceship arrived at Harrisville and the league call the alpha strike to determine if its a 
treat or not. When they went they initiated their defense formation. Then Jackson went to communicate with the aliens. He found out that the alien 
were only trying to find a new planet to live. So Jackson (shadow striker) told the aliens to go to mars and since then mars has always being habited.<br><br>
