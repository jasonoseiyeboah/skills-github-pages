<h1> POWER BOY THE HERO PART 2 </h1>

<p> <br> Power Boy still lived in Harrisville. He had fought a lot of villains and made a lot of enemies like invisible-z, 
night ninja and many more. He also got himself a trainer to learn martial arts, which also made him a better superhero. <br> <br>

One day when he was walking by, he saw some aliens on a network pole. So he went to change into his super suit and went 
there. When he got there, the aliens contacted the others to destroy the city. Then he got scared and went to his trainer, 
Mr Clouds. Then he gave him a suit that will give him powers. <br> <br> 

Mr. Clouds said it can give him the power him the power to fly, super strength, super speed and other super human abilities. 
Then Power Boy realised the aliens are too powerful so he asked Mr Clouds for help. Then Mr Clouds opened a portal that links 
to the universe and its heroes. <br> <br>

He then went to call some superheroes from the portal. He called in fly man, black star and twists the ninja. Before they went 
Mr Clouds told them that since they are part of the mission "if you lose your planets will be destroyed too". Then they set out 
to fight the aliens. <br> <br>

After fighting they won the Fly man, Black star and Twist the ninja left some items for Power Boy. So that he will remember them.
